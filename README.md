# JimBob
Welcome to my project, this is something I've been pondering for a few years and have made a few tentative stabs at previously but they fizzled out rather quickly. Hopefully this one works out better. 

# Background
This comes from my belief that starting with artificial intelligence is doomed to failure. We didn't start intelligent (as a species or individual), we started stupid and had to work our way up to being the (generally) intelligent beings that we are.

# Status
I just started this, so still very early days. I think I have the basics written for it to be able to add new classes to itself and then reload itself to be able to add those commands. There are probably a bunch of bugs as its been a while since I touched python.
